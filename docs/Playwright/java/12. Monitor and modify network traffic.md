<!-- # [Monitor and modify network traffic](https://playwright.dev/docs/network)

In this section, we will see how we can intercept network traffic, write logs and modify the network traffic. This can be useful when we want to get a better understanding of the front end dependencies in our web application. Also in scenarios where we don't want to depend on external data (with the use of mocking) this can be extremely useful.

## Exercise: Logging a request and response

Create a new test and log all the requests and responses.

You can find more info on how to log network events [HERE](https://playwright.dev/docs/network#network-events).

Do you notice the ordering? The `page.on` event needs to be defined before the event happens. It has to "subscribe" to the request and response events.

## Exercise: Narrowing down your logging

- Rewrite your test to log only the request and response of the songs.
- Create a new test that only logs image related responses

## Exercise: Handle requests (mocking)

In some scenarios it may be useful to mock the response of certain request. For example, if we want to test various scenarios without modifying the data in the database.

This can be done with the [page.route](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route) method.

Create a new test that returns the following data when the songs endpoint is called:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1000,
    "title": "My own random song",
    "artist": "Me",
    "genre": "Random",
    "album": "Random album",
    "albumImageUrl": "https://picsum.photos/268",
    "youtubeId": "",
    "lyrics": "",
    "tab": ""
  }
]
```

You can read [HERE](https://playwright.dev/docs/network#modify-responses) on how to achieve this.
It may be tricky to get the correct response.

TIP: stringify your JSON mock and if you get stuck, please ask.

How can you debug this and verify that your mock is returned? -->
